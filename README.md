## Taegyeong Lee

Hi, I'm **Taegyeong Lee**. I'm passionate about novel research that explores generating images or videos from audio and text—integrating various modalities. I enjoy conducting research that is **simple yet effective**, leveraging multimodal and generative models to make a strong impact in the real world.

I am currently working as a research intern on the [FnGuide LLM TFT](https://www.fnguide.com), focusing on LLMs and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Previously, I earned my Master’s degree from the UNIST AIGS. I interned at the [ETRI](https://www.etri.re.kr/intro.html) and completed the [Software Maestro 8th](https://www.swmaestro.org/sw/main/main.do). I also served as a software developer in the [Promotion Data Management Division](https://www.army.mil.kr/sites/army/index.do) at the Republic of Korea Army Headquarters. I hold a Bachelor of Computer Engineering from Pukyong National University.
