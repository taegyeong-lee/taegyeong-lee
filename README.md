<h2> Taegyeong Lee </h4>
Hello, I am a Ph.D student in MVLLAB at Artificial Intelligence Graduate School (UNIST). I am fortunate to be advised by Taehwan Kim.

My main research areas are **AI for Finance, Generative Models** and **Multimodal Learning**. I am specifically interested in novel research that generates images or videos from audio or text (various modalities). Just as humans can think and infer from various senses, I believe that the various modalities and generative models can have a significant impact on our community in the future.
