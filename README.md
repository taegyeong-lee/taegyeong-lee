**Hi, I am Taegyeong Lee**. I am interested in novel research(GenAI, Multi-modal AI, LLMs) that generates images or videos from audio or text (various modalities). Just as humans can think and infer from various senses, I believe that the various modalities and generative models can have a significant impact on our community in the future. 
I completed my Master's degree at the UNIST Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence. I am currently serving as an intern on the LLM TFT at <a href='https://www.fnguide.com/'>FnGuide</a>.
Previously, I interned at the <a href='https://www.etri.re.kr/intro.html'>Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI)</a> and completed the <a href='https://www.swmaestro.org/sw/main/main.do'>Software Maestro 8th program</a>, sponsored by the Ministry of Science and ICT on Republic of Korea. 
I also served as a software developer soldier in the <a href='https://www.army.mil.kr/sites/army/index.do'>Promotion Data Management Division of the Republic of Korea Army Headquarters</a>. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering from Pukyong National University.
