Hi, I am Taegyeong Lee. I am interested in novel research that generates images or videos from audio or text (various modalities). Just as humans can think and infer from various senses, I believe that the various modalities and generative models can have a significant impact on our community in the future. 
I completed my Master's degree at the UNIST Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence, where I was advised by Professor Taehwan Kim. 
Previously, I interned at the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) and successfully completed the 8th cohort of the Software Maestro program, sponsored by the Ministry of Science and ICT on Republic of Korea. 
I also served as a software developer soldier in the Promotion Data Management Division of the Personnel Command at the Republic of Korea Army Headquarters. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering from Pukyong National University.
